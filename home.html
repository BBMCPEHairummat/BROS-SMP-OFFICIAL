																				Welcome to Bros SMP Server this server is made by "BEAST BOY MCPE" this server is like other servers but with rules and regulations and the most common rule is that no one can use slang language in the group and yes there is a group to message our friends when you are going online and we also inform you about server updates and we sometimes do a bumper offer ocassion and I am not going to tell to about bumper offer I will send it in the group and back to the point that slanging is banned because some of the members do not have there own mobile/pc like me thats why it is banned and the group is never closed (only admins can send message) so you can ask any that you are confused of and don't worry of dying because every new member gets a VIP Shulker and if you are thinking what is VS (VIP Shulker) VS is a starter pack if you have conclusion ask me in the group and there are also some mini games like MGame.io (made by "BEAST BOY MCPE") and Tower of Mad (made by "Hairummat"/"hestelboy") and much more you can also make a some Games and every new member gets a free land to build his/her house or store and no one can steal stuff from your house or store if anyone steals you can do a case about him and our server also has a court and our server also have a currency which is craftable so you can craft it and we also decide our president every week on sunday you can vote for president and there is no cost of land in the nether so if you don't have money you can build in the nether but it is dengerous and that's the introduction of Bros SMP Server and if you play in multiplayer servers then it is more enjoyable than playing in singleplayer world and enjoy here.
